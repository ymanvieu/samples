# Lombok-mapstruct

Lombok-mapstruct illustrates how to use Lombok and Mapstruct in the same projet.

It is now possible thanks to [fix #973](https://github.com/rzwitserloot/lombok/issues/973) in Lombok 1.16.14.

## Requirements
Lombok-mapstruct requires Java 1.7+

### Eclipse IDE
#### Lombok
To see methods generated by Lombok in Eclipe, you have to [install/update](https://projectlombok.org/download.html) it (update is mandatory if you have an older version of Lombok installed)

#### Mapstruct and m2e-apt plugin
To have instant generation of mappings implementation in Eclipse, [follow the instructions](http://mapstruct.org/documentation/ide-support/#maven-integration)

#### MapStruct plugin (optional)
To ease object mappings with Maptruct, you can install the official [mapstruct-plugin](http://mapstruct.org/documentation/ide-support/#editing-support) to enable auto-completion and other cool stuff.

## Building from Source
